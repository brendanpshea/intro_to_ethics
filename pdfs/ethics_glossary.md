| Dialectical Method | A sophisticated form of philosophical investigation using structured conversation and logical analysis to progress from common beliefs to higher understanding. Involves systematic questioning, hypothesis testing, and rational argument |
| Ring of Gyges | An ethical thought experiment exploring whether people would behave justly if freed from social consequences, using the story of a shepherd who discovers a ring granting invisibility. Questions whether justice is intrinsically valuable |
